## Review

#### Project Purpose

Contribute! is an app where users can giveaway, borrow or exchange items.

#### Project Organization

#### Features

  * A user is able to add new contributions via a contribution form. In this form, the nature of the contribution such as the action, item,collection address etc, are captured by the database.

  * After adding a new contribution, a user is also able to view all contributions made and even add comments to these contributions.

  * Contributions can also be updated and deleted by the user that created it.

  * Signup, Login and Logout features available for users.

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Javascript
  * Codes are well split and organised in folders, adhering to the MVC principle

  * Creation of middleware folder makes the organisation of files clean for special middleware.

  * Cool use of Cloudinary for users to upload pictures for contributions!

* UI
  * User experience flow is simple and easy to understand and pick up.

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* General
  * Can possibly allow editing of cloudinary uploaded image. Currently, it only allows a one time upload and user is unable to change the photo to another one.

* CSS
  * For the cloudinary uploaded photos, increase size of image to make contribution item clearer.
