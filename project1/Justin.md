## Review

#### Project Purpose

Create a 2 player Texas Hold'Em poker game

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Wait time stimulation
  * Uses setTimeOut to stimulate waiting time between turns transition in actual game.
* Determining winner of the round
  * Using of pokersolver library to help in determining the winner.
* God Mode
  * Toggle class using click event. Good for debugging demo purposes.

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Well documented code
  * Documentation make it easier to understand the intention of the functions
* Grouping variables by types (eg. buttons, game variables, card display etc.)
  * It makes the code neater and makes it easier to find the variable that you want while coding.

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Quite a number of repeated codes
  * Possible to write small functions to house blocks of repeated codes to keep it 'DRY'.
* The game site looks quite plain
  * Possible to add in background image and use pictures of poker cards to make the game more lively.

## Additional Notes

Can see that a lot of effort have been put in trying to create a complicated game. Good job and 加油！:)
